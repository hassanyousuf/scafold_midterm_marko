<h2>History: Halal-ink</h2>
<p>Halal-ink has been introduced to our muslim brothers and sister as a
   “halal” was to leave a (temperary) mark on there skin for the special occasion.
   We feel that muslims should have the chance to  have a tattoo that they think
   looks nice. What we do is make sure it isn’t permanent. Just like conventional henna,
   our Halal-ink is made with the same products but we use a fine point pen and
   new techneques to give a more tattoo like appeal.</p>
